                    <p>The AI analyzes data such as age, weight, height, gender, dietary preferences, health goals, and any specific health conditions (like diabetes or allergies). Using this data, it recommends a customized meal plan designed to meet your nutritional needs and personal goals.</p>

                    <p>Yes! The AI can tailor diet plans based on your dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb diets. It can also adjust to any food allergies, intolerances, or personal restrictions you specify.</p>

                    <p>The AI is trained on extensive nutritional data and guidelines from trusted health sources.

                    <p>Absolutely! As you make progress or if your goals change (e.g., weight loss to muscle gain), you can update your profile. The AI will adjust your diet plan accordingly to ensure it aligns with your new objectives.</p>
